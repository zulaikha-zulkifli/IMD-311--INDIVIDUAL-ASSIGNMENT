	<p> i really love to travel, before pandemic, me and family will go to travel together, we already travel to jakarta, vietnam, korea, hatyai, bangkok, perth australia and a few place. i have learn a lot during my travelling, one of it are about cleanliness, especially at korea and australia, their country are clean from rubbish, either road nor public transport. it really make me realize, cleanliness are really important, means we can do it at our country. maybe the tourist who's come to our country will think the same things with me? wht not hehe. beside of keeping our country clean, we also can raise the name of our country.</p>
