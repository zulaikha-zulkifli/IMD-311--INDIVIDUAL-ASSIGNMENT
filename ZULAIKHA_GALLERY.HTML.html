	<b><h2>MEMORIES 2021</h2></b>
	<p>24 september 2021, my family has been diagnosed positive covid-19. i still cant forget it because my mother should stay in the hospital and has been diagnosed covid -19 stage 4. even tho me and my siblings can quarantine at home, it's difference when our mother are at the hospital and my father at quarantine center. please, stay at home, sanitize your hand frenquently, wear a mask anywhere you go. covid-19 is real and the effect after covid-19 still there. im just sharing based on my experience. </p>
